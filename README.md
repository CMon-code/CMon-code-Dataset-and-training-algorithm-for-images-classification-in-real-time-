# CMon-code-Dataset-and-training-algorithm-for-images-classification-in-real-time-




For research scope, 2 datasets have been created from scratch ( a small and a relatively large) considering Cobots at work in different conditions to demonstrate how the number of images and annotations as well as how the data augmentation applied are fundamental to obtain best results after the application of a training algorithm for a good image detection in real-time.
